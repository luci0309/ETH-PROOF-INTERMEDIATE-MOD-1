# Admission In School Contract

## Description
The Admission In School project is a simple smart contract built in Solidity programming language. It allows managing student admissions, finding the maximum number of students, and updating the maximum number of students dynamically. The contract employs Solidity's require(), assert(), and revert() keywords to handle input validation and error conditions effectively.

## Getting Started

### Installing
To run this program, you need to have the Solidity compiler installed on your system. Alternatively, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE available at [Remix Ethereum](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

### Executing program
1. Navigate to the Remix website.
2. Create a new file using the "+" sign in the left-hand sidebar and save it with a .sol extension.
3. Switch to the "Solidity Compiler" tab, ensure the compiler version matches the pragma in the code, and click on the "SchoolAdmission.sol" icon to compile the code.
4. Deploy the contract by entering a value for "_MaximumStudents" under the "Deploy" tab in the left-hand sidebar.


   
## Usage

Check student eligibility by calling the AdmissionOfStudents function with the student's name and marks.
Retrieve the maximum number of students allowed by calling the MaximumStudents function.
Update the maximum number of students by calling the UpdateMaximumNumberOfStudents function.
View student information using the StudentInformation function.
